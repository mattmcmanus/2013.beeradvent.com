### The Brewery

The Brasserie d'Achouffe is a Belgian brewery based in Achouffe. It was founded in 1982 by two brothers-in-law, Pierre Gobron and Christian Bauweraerts, as a hobby. In 1984, Gobron decided to quit his job and to concentrate on his brewery, joined four years later by Bauweraerts. That year (1988), they began to export the beer to Quebec. In September 2006, the brewery was bought by the brewery group Duvel Moortgat. [(Source)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasserie_d'Achouffe)

### The Beer

The Houblon Chouffe was brewed for the first time in 2006.  It is an ‘Indian Pale ale’ type of beer, with a harmonious balance between a marked bitterness (three types of hops are used to make it) and a pleasant fruitiness.  The HOUBLON CHOUFFE is unfiltered, and re-fermented in the bottle as well as in the keg. [(Source)](http://www.achouffe.be/en/nos-bieres/nos-produits/)
