### The Brewery

The Dark Horse Brewery is a microbrewery and tap room in Marshall, Michigan. The Dark Horse brews a variety of beers and beer styles, including the Crooked Tree India Pale Ale, Amber Ale, Raspberry Ale, Sapient Trip Ale, Boffo Brown Beer, and Black Bier. Several seasonal and experimental brews are also produced. They also offer a wide variety of food, with the cuisine centered around items which can be produced in their pizza ovens. Dark Horse put out a significant amount of beer for their tank size but are still able to hand-fold and stock every six-pack produced. The brewery has won several medals at various brewing competitions. [(Source)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Horse_Brewery)

### The Beer

Conceived in a dimly lit room on a blistery cold night in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, but born and raised here in Marshall Michigan. The Reserve Special is the oldest of all beers in the Dark Horse family. It has an incredibly “thick” presence and when poured into a glass its color is so dark it’s eerie. The flavors explode onto your taste buds with heavy malt, roast, and chocolate, but stay very balanced. The Reserve Special Black Ale has a hard time being called a stout or porter but it fits nicely into the category of a delicious strong black ale.
