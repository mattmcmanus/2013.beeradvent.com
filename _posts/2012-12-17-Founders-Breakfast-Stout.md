### The Beer

This beer was in the first Beer Advent!

The coffee lover's consummate beer. Brewed with an abundance of flaked oats, bitter and imported chocolates, and Sumatra and Kona coffee, this stout has an intense fresh roasted java nose topped with a frothy, cinnamon-colored head that goes forever.

### The Brewery

Founders Brewing Company is an award-winning craft brewery located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The brewery was founded in Grand Rapids in 1997 by Mike Stevens and Dave Engbers, homebrewing enthusiasts who had recently graduated from college. Since the mid-2000s, it has become one of the most prominent breweries in Michigan, expanding its market to 15 states and its production capacity to 30,000 barrels per year.
