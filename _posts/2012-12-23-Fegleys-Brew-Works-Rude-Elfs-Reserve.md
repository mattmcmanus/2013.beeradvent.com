### The Brewery

At one of the most difficult times in the history of the City of Bethlehem, the Fegley family entered the brewing and restaurant business. The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years – a dying industrial giant of a bygone day – and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.

Bethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of ‘Steel’ and paid tribute to the region’s working class culture in it’s decor and menu. The Fegley’s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds. [(Source)](http://www.thebrewworks.com/about-us/)

### The Beer

Brewed with 2-row pale & caramel malts, dark Belgian Candi Sugar, & three Belgian yeast strains. Brewed with hints of Holiday spice – cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger & clove, hopped with German Tettnang hops. This aromatic Holiday Ale is ready to open this year, but a few ‘wise men’ may cellar it to discover it’s ‘true meaning.’ [(Source)](http://www.thebrewworks.com/brews/seasonal-beers/rude-elfs-reserve/)
