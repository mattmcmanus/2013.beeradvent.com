# Dearest Beer Adventers,

I wish I was writing a letter to you all filled with good tidings of great beer, but alas, I am not. Beer Advent is going to look a little different this year. Due too some ongoing medical needs of my family, I have been unable to run the Beer Advent as it's been run in the past. Is Beer Advent dead? NO! It's simply that I wasn't able to put in all the work necessary this year. I'm just as bummed as you are, but priorities are priorities!

### We're having a beer swap instead! Think of it like Pogs, for beer!

I desperately want to keep the spirit and tradition of this glorious adventure moving forward, so hear me out. **We're still having a kickoff party on December 1st**. Rather than paying money and leaving with a case of carefully hand selected ales, we're having an epic Beer Swap. Show up with whatever beer you're willing a trade (A case, a rare bottle, an amazing 6 pack) and see what you treasures you can leave with. Use the [Beer Advent Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/beeradvent) to try and line up your own beer advent case if you would like or just enjoy the adventure!

### Details on the swap

* It will be hosted, once again, at the glorious [P'unk ave](http://punkave.com)
* Bring whatever beer you're interested in trading. This is completely free form. Bring a case and try to leave with a good mix of beers. Bring an amazing Trappist beer and see how many other beers you can get for it. It's up to you!
* Details about other food and drink will come soon
