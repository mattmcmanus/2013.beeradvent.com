# Dearest Beer Adventers,

I wish I was writing a letter to you all filled with good tidings of great beer, but alas, I am not. Beer Advent is going to look a little different this year. Due too some ongoing medical needs of my family, I have been and will continue this year to be unable to run the Beer Advent as it's been run in the past. Is Beer Advent dead? NO! It's simply that I wasn't able to put in all the work neccesary this year.

### We're having a beer swap instead! Think of it like Pogs, for beer!

I desperately want to keep the spirit and tradition of this glorious adventure moving forward, so hear me out. **We're still having a kickoff party on December 1st**. Rather than you paying money and leaving with a case of carefully hand selected ales, we're having an epic Beer Swap. Show up with whatever beer you're willing a trade (A case, a rare bottle, an amazing 6 pack) and see what you treasures you can leave with.
